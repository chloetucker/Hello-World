# Hello, World Application
## Summary
> This tiny application asks for the user's name, takes the user's input, and returns a string that includes the user's input. This is easy but touches several important areas, such as setting up a Python development environment (installing Python 3 and Pycharm), creating a Pycharm project, and creating a Github repository.
### Outcome

## Ideas
- Expand this application and rename to "Small Talk." App to include common questions in small talk (i.e. how's the weather?) and a limited number of answers. The goal would be to get to a point where the computer tells you its life story.
